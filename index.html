            <p class="news2">
                Democratic and Republican presidential candidates Jack Kennedy, left, and Dick Nixon stand underneath
                glaring
                lights prior to beginning their 1st TV debate.</p>

            <p class="news2"> On the morning of September 26, 1960, John F. Kennedy was a relatively unknown senator
                from
                Massachusetts. He
                was young and Catholic — neither of which helped his image — and facing off against an incumbent. But by
                the end of the evening, he was a star.</p>
            <p class="news2">It's now common knowledge that without the nation's first televised debate — fifty years
                ago Sunday —
                Kennedy
                would never have been president. But beyond securing his presidential career, the 60-minute duel between
                the
                handsome Irish-American senator and Vice President Richard Nixon fundamentally altered political
                campaigns,
                television media and America's political history. "It's one of those unusual points on the timeline of
                history where you can say things changed very dramatically — in this case, in a single night," says Alan
                Schroeder, a media historian and associate professor at Northeastern University, who authored the book,
                <i>Presidential Debates: Forty Years of High-Risk TV</i>
            </p>
            <p class="news">Kennedy's aide and speech writer, Ted Sorensen remembers prepping the candidate for the big
                night. They
                were
                on the roof of their Chicago hotel, running through a pile of note cards, quizzing Kennedy on the likely
                debate topics while he worked on his tan. "We knew the first televised debate was important, but we had
                no
                idea how important it was going to turn out," Sorensen told TIME. After hours of practice and a speech
                before a labor union, the senator went in to take a nap. "The story I like to tell is of when they
                delegated
                me to go wake him up," Sorensen said. "I opened the door and peaked in and there he was, lights on,
                sound
                asleep, covered in notecards."</p>
            <p class="news">What happened after the two candidates took the stage is a familiar tale. Nixon, pale and
                underweight
                from a
                recent hospitalization, appeared sickly and sweaty, while Kennedy appeared calm and confident. As the
                story
                goes, those who listened to the debate on the radio thought Nixon had won. But those listeners were in
                the
                minority. By 1960, 88% of American households had televisions — up from just 11% the decade before. The
                number of viewers who tuned in to the debate has been estimated as high as 74 million, by the Nielsen of
                the
                day, <i>Broadcast Magazine.</i> Those that watched the debate on TV thought Kennedy was the clear
                winner.
                Many say
                Kennedy won the election that night. Sorensen says the Kennedy team didn't realize what a game changer
                the
                debate was until the following day at a campaign event in Ohio. "The crowds for his motorcade were much
                larger than they'd ever been," he says. "That's when we knew that, if nothing else, Kennedy had firmed
                up
                support for himself in the Democratic party."</p>
            <p class="news">Nixon performed much better in the subsequent debates (and appeared better thanks to the
                "milkshake diet"
                his
                aides put him on to fatten him up). But, as Schroeder says, the damage had been done. "You couldn't wipe
                away the image people had seared in their brains from the first debate." Even Kennedy acknowledged the
                medium's role in his victory. On November 12, 1960, four days after winning the election by a narrow
                margin,
                he said, "It was the TV more than anything else that turned the tide." Post-debate, candidates could no
                longer afford to ignore the potential power of television. "With the Nation Watching," a 1979 task force
                report, notes, "The Nixon-Kennedy debates made televised encounters between candidates the hottest thing
                in
                electioneering since the campaign button."</p>
            <p class="news">Up to that point, politics had not really been played out on television. "It was very much
                an
                entertainment
                medium," says Schroeder. "It wasn't a place for serious discourse." The next televised presidential
                debate
                wouldn't take place for 16 years, largely because candidates became wary of their influence. Lyndon B.
                Johnson was too intimidated by the medium to take on Barry Goldwater in 1964, and Nixon, having been
                burned
                before, refused to debate on TV in both 1968 and 1972. Televised debates reemerged 1976, when incumbent
                president Gerald Ford agreed to take on his Democratic challenger, Jimmy Carter. They've been standard
                practice in each campaign season since.</p>
            <p class="news">After the debate, how you presented yourself, what you looked like, how you sounded and
                whether you
                connected
                directly with audiences mattered, says Larry Sabato, political analyst at the Center for Politics at the
                University of Virginia and author of the forthcoming book, <i>The Kennedy Half-Century.</i> "Before the
                television
                debates most Americans didn't even see the candidates — they read about them, they saw photos of them,"
                he
                told TIME. "This allowed the public to judge candidates on a completely different basis." It's a reality
                that continues to influence campaigns today. "When parties are considering their candidates they ask:
                Who
                would look better on TV? Who comes across better? Who can debate better?" Sabato says. "This has been
                taken
                into the calculus."</p>
            <p class="news">Beyond what the debate meant for the political arena, by catapulting Kennedy to the
                presidency, Sorensen
                speculates it fundamentally altered the world as we know it. In 1962, President Kennedy famously refused
                the
                recommendation by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to respond, militarily, to the Soviet Union's placing of
                nuclear
                missiles in Cuba. Sorensen said he is sure Nixon would have taken the Joint Chiefs advice ("he was more
                hawkish on military matters," he says). "Had [Nixon] done as the Joint Chiefs urged it would have
                started a
                nuclear war from which nobody would have survived," Sorensen said. "I think we should certainly be
                grateful
                that John F. Kennedy won that debate."</p><br>
